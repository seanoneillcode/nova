### Goal:
Add more story to the prototype

### Ideas:
 * dialog with characters using portraits and text 
 * distinct levels with obvious challenges and defined solution
 * story line with characters, goal, environment.

### Storyline:
The player (Vent) and their buddy (Patches) land their space ship on a remote planet, looking for more fuel so they can continue. The fuel is a crystal. They lans in a remote section of forest near a village, to get information on the location of fuel. When they land they get attacked. The player's first goal is to survive. After the attack the player's goal is to get to 
the village. They must fight creatures to get there. 

At the village the player gets information. There is a baron controlling the villages nearby. The baron has super advanced technology, on a par with the players, which allows him to rule the villages as a dictator. No body can stop the baron. The village does not have the fuel but the baron might. The player can add an extra goal if they choose, to save the villagers and remove the baron. The player's main goal is to go to the baron for fuel.

The player must fight more creatures to get to the castle. At the castle they talk to the baron. They can get fuel without fighting but the baron remains and the villagers subjected. The player can ignore them and just trade for the fuel. The player can also kill the baron and take the fuel for free.

Fighting the baron is a boss fight. The baron has robot guards. 

The player must return to the ship with the fuel.

If the player kills the baron, they can return to the village and gain closure.
